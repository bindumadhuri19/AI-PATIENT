# AI Patient Dashboard README
#1. Project Overview
   
1.1 Objective
The AI Health Advisor Dashboard is a Tableau-based visualization tool developed to provide healthcare professionals with a comprehensive, real-time view of patient data. This project was undertaken to showcase my ability to integrate advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and interactive design, aligning with my goal to contribute to data-driven healthcare solutions.

1.2 Purpose and Motivation
I initiated this project to address the growing need for proactive patient care in healthcare settings, where timely insights can improve outcomes and reduce costs. Inspired by the integration of AI and IoT in modern healthcare, I aimed to create a portfolio piece that demonstrates my skills in data engineering, visualization, and problem-solving, making me a strong candidate for data analytics or healthcare IT roles.

1.3 Key Features

Real-Time AI Risk Predictions: Displays readmission and fall risk scores using machine learning insights.
Proactive Care Recommendations: Offers automated alerts to support clinical decision-making.
Longitudinal Patient Journey: Visualizes health trends over time.
Wearable/IoT Integration: Incorporates live vitals (heart rate, steps, blood oxygen).
Interactive Navigation: Clickable icons for seamless access to patient overview, lab trends, vital signs, and medication alerts.

1.4 Target Audience
Healthcare providers, clinicians, and data analysts seeking actionable patient insights.
1.5 Technical Stack

Visualization Tool: Tableau Desktop 2023.1+
Data Warehouse: Snowflake (SNOWFLAKE_LEARNING_DB, PUBLIC schema)
Data Sources: PATIENTS, MEDICATIONS, LAB_RESULTS, WEARABLES, RISK_SCORES, PATIENT_SUMMARY (view)
Use Case
This dashboard is designed for use in hospitals or clinics to monitor patient health, predict risks, and recommend interventions. For example, a clinician can use it to identify a patient with a high fall risk (e.g., FALL_RISK > 0.7) and receive an "Urgent: Contact clinician" alert, enabling immediate action.

2 Benefits

Improved Patient Outcomes: Early risk detection reduces readmissions and incidents.
Efficiency: Real-time data and interactive features save time for healthcare staff.
Scalability: Supports integration with larger datasets or additional IoT devices.
